Learning styles are seemingly universal, which is not what we originally thought. 
As the article points out, most students would benefit more from using many different learning styles and mixing up the way they intake their
information. This is in stark contrast to the commonly held beleif which is that everyone learns in a different specific way. In reality,
although we all have small differences in personal preference, our brains are actually better at learning from a small doses of every learning 
style.
