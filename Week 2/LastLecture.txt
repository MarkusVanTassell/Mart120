Randy Pausch is an example of the power of human spirit. I really empathized with his passion for childhood dreams, and I think that
remembering to have a positive attitude. Despite the fact that the tumors in his head is unchangeable, he was able to prove how hard he 
wanted things in life. You can tell immediately that Pausch is a positive, powerful guy. He effortlessly gets along with the crowd, he's funny, and most of all positive. He even shows childhood pictures of him smiling to show how positivity affects your life as you grow older. 
This video was very powerful. It made me feel inspired to pursue what Iâ€™m dreaming of, because it puts into perspective what can be overcome in life.
