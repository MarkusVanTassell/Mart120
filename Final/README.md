For my final project I wanted to do something with p5.js that reflected my love of art, color, and peace.
In order to do this, I focused on making intersting imagery the best I could by randomizing the way colors changed, and adding in bouncing objects that act as obstacles for our moving circle.
One of the failures I encountered was being able to incorporate mixed media, as although I added an image to my asset files, appearantly there is a glitch on some browsers that prevents images from loading in p5.js, which was very strange.
Although I couldn't use my mixed media, I was able to create a peace sign out of basic shapes, which was very finnicky, but I was able to do it.
I started by creating the color generator, which was a strange process of trial and error, but I was able to find a system I liked eventually. 
I thought the randomized snake thing was a good addition, and it was interesting to incorporate arrays into my project.
The reason I have an "exit" is to make the piece feel more like a game, but in reality it's designed to just sit and watch as you play around inside of it. I wanted it to be visually stimulating.
The reason I chose peace as a theme for this project, was because it is something that we could definitely stand to ponder on in American society today. 
Overseas conflicts, internal dispute, political divide, I think that despite all these things, it is important to remember a value above them all: PEACE.
For this reason, I created my final in hopes that it would offer a space where someone could idlely move their hands and eyes, but internally reflect on the idea of peace and love.
Art is an important tool in expressing political and philosophical messages, and for this reason I think that creative coding is a powerful medium to create safe spaces that people can reflect in.
Moving forward, I would like to explore the idea of a "digital space" and the creation of media that helps humans meditate or ponder upon a certain theme.
